 Breast Cancer Classification using Supervised Learning
This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from sklearn.datasets.

🎯 Objective
The goal of this assessment is to evaluate and compare the performance of various classification algorithms on a real-world medical dataset.

📊 Dataset
Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()
Instances: 569
Features: 30 numeric features
Target: Binary (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)
🛠️ Preprocessing Steps
Checked for missing values (none found).
Standardized the features using StandardScaler to normalize data.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).
🧪 Algorithms Used
Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated using accuracy and a classification report.

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Each model includes a brief explanation and justification within the notebook.
